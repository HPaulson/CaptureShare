# CaptureShare: Your home for file sharing.

## Features

* REST API build using Express for uploading, getting, deleting, and managing files

* Support for POST upload requests from services such as ShareX and MagicCap

* A beautiful dashboard built using Vue to provide a home for uploading, deleting, and managing files! (NOTE: The CaptureShare dashboard is currently a Work In Progress. Although it functions as expected, currently all features and styling has not yet been implemented)

* Fast, efficient, and very easy to setup and use!
---
